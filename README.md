## What?

This repository exposes an untouched Ignite Expo based app generated with the ignite-cli
`nnpx ignite-cli new IgniteDiffApp --expo`. Each new Ignite release causes a new project to be created, removing the old one, and getting a diff between them. This way, the diff is always clean, always in sync with the changes of the init template.
